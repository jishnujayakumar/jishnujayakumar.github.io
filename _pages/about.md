I am a first-year MSCS (Master's in Computer Science) student in the [Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"}. Here, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/){:target="_blank"}(IRVL) under [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

Before I joined UTD, I worked as a Research Intern under the supervision of [Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/){:target="_blank"} at [CNeRG](http://cnerg.org){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. <!--Simultaneously, I am working as a Remote Summer Intern under the supervision of [Dr. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/){:target="_blank"} at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}. --> Previously, I was a Research Intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru. Before this, I was a Research { Intern, Assistant, Associate } at [RBCCPS](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. Here, out of the many exciting projects, I was fortunate to work on [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in/){:target="_blank"}, funded by [MoHUA](http://mohua.gov.in/){:target="_blank"}, right from its inception and thereby contributed an ounce towards the progress of the [Smart Cities Mission](https://smartcities.gov.in/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I was a Research Assistant at [IIIT Vadodara](https://iiitv.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. I completed my graduation from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT, an institute of national importance under the [Act of Parliament](https://egazette.nic.in/writereaddata/2017/177925.pdf){:target="_blank"}) Vadodara in 2017. For my Baccalaureate thesis, I worked on developing a sequential approach for noninferiority or equivalence of a linear contrast under cost constraints under the supervision of [Dr. Bhargab Chattopadhyay](https://iimv.ac.in/faculty/faculty-area-wise?view=article&id=142:bhargab&catid=56:faculty-profile){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Pradipta Ray](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~pradiptaray/){:target="_blank"}. 

I am broadly interested in applying machine learning to solve research problems including but not limited to the domain of vision, speech, or text. My recent research works have focused on knowledge graph embeddings, question answering, and representation learning of legal documents. Currently, I am working on **Vision aided Robotics** using **Few-Shot Learning**.

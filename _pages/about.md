I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the [Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"}. I work at [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/){:target="_blank"}(IRVL) under [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I was an MSCS (Master’s in Computer Science) student at the same school from Fall 2021-Spring 2022.

Before I joined UTD, I worked as a Research Intern under the supervision of [Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/){:target="_blank"} at [CNeRG](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a Research Intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru. Before this, I spent two wonderful years as a Research { Intern, Assistant, Associate } at [RBCCPS](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I was a Research Assistant at IIIT Vadodara. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT, an institute of national importance under the [Act of Parliament](https://egazette.nic.in/writereaddata/2017/177925.pdf){:target="_blank"}) Vadodara in 2017. For my Baccalaureate thesis, I worked with [Dr. Bhargab Chattopadhyay](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/123829){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Pradipta Ray](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~pradiptaray/){:target="_blank"} on developing a sequential approach for noninferiority or equivalence of linear contrast under cost constraints.

My research centers on robot perception and few-shot learning for object recognition and manipulation. I focus on enabling robots to learn from vision-language inputs and human demonstrations, with an emphasis on building efficient, generalizable representations. I’m especially interested in developing and applying foundation models for real-world embodied tasks.

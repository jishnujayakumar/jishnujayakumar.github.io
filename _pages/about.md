I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science](https://engineering.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu){:target="_blank"}. I work at [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/){:target="_blank"}(IRVL) under [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I was an MSCS (Masterâ€™s in Computer Science) student at the same school from Fall 2021-Spring 2022.

Before I joined UTD, I worked as a Research Intern under the supervision of [Dr. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/){:target="_blank"} at [CNeRG](http://cnerg.org){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I was a Research Intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru. Before this, I spent two wonderful years as a Research { Intern, Assistant, Associate } at [RBCCPS](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. Before this, I was a Research Assistant at IIIT Vadodara. I graduated from the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT, an institute of national importance under the [Act of Parliament](https://egazette.nic.in/writereaddata/2017/177925.pdf){:target="_blank"}) Vadodara in 2017. For my Baccalaureate thesis, I worked with [Dr. Bhargab Chattopadhyay](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/123829){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Pradipta Ray](https://www.pradiptaray.com){:target="_blank"} on developing a sequential approach for noninferiority or equivalence of linear contrast under cost constraints.

I am broadly interested in applying machine learning to solve research problems, including but not limited to the domain of vision, speech, or text. My recent research has focused on knowledge graph embeddings, question answering, and representation learning of legal documents. Currently, I am working on improving **Robot Perception** using **Few-Shot Learning**.
